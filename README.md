# WordListFormatter
Word list formatting program promoting time efficiency through better formatting.  

Combines multiple word lists, and provides the options of optimizing the resulting 
combination through sorting the word list lines from smallest to largest, removing 
lines that contain non-printable character codes, and the option to remove lines 
containing greater than a maximum defined limit.  

This reduces the processing time spent attempting strings of characters that are 
likely too long to possibly be passwords, removing strings that contain characters 
that in most all cases could not possibly be useable passwords, and again, sorting 
the lists from smallest to largest, with the most likely use-cases proposed in the 
former portion of the word list search.  

Created using Java SDK 11.0.9 and JavaFX 11.0.2, using Maven and Intellij
